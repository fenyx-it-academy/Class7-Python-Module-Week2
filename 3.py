# ### 3.
# Write a program that takes in two words as input and returns a list containing three elements,
#  in the following order:
# -		Shared letters between two words.
 	
# -		Letters unique to word 1.
 	
# -		Letters unique to word 2.

# Each element of the output should have unique letters, and should be alphabetically sorted. Use set operations. 
# The strings will always be in lowercase and will not contain any punctuation.

# ```
# Example
# Input1>>> "sharp"
# Input2>>> "soap"
# Output>>> ['aps', 'hr', 'o']
# ```
